## How to Customize Styles

You can create three files under `.vuepress/styles` folder in your own document for style customization.

- `index.scss`: You can place your own styles via CSS or SCSS syntax to modify the appearance of the theme here.

  These styles will be injected after theme and plugin styles.

- `config.scss`: You can set some style related variables here, including responsive breakpoints, container class names, code themes, etc.

- `palette.scss`: You can set some color and layout related variables here, such as theme color, background color, navbar height, etc.

For the complete config list supported by the above files, see [Config â†’ Style](../../config/style.md).
